# Automate-browser

An autonomous web automation agent powered by **Playwright**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI**.
This project demonstrates how an LLM can control a real browser, execute actions step-by-step, and verify progress dynamically.

---

## Features

- LLM-driven decision-making (LangChain + OpenAI)
- Browser control via Playwright
- Step-by-step reasoning with tool invocation
- Automatic screenshots after each action
- JSON-based action parsing and reporting
